Following a failed attempt in 2014, Paul Valin embarked on a second expedition to Mount Everest in 2018, after being motivated by his team member Henry's final year of climbing before retirement... <br><br>
The entire expedition took five weeks to complete. The most grueling part of the climb was the final push to the summit from Camp Four, which began at 8 p.m. after 15 hours of no sleep. After seven hours of climbing, the team reached a "balcony" at 3 a.m., where the climber experienced a perilous drop in body temperature, leaving him unable to feel his fingers. This extremely unsafe situation was overcome by finding a newfound mental strength, which, along with the rising sun, gave him the determination to continue. At 7:10 a.m. on May 21st, he reached the summit where he spent 40 minutes before beginning the treacherous 12-hour descent.<br><br> Reflecting on the climb, he believes his success was 50% luck and 50% a combination of mental strength, physical ability, and technical skills, with mental fortitude being the most critical factor. The experience taught him about his limits and the importance of teamwork.
